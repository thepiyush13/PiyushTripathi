# what

Terraform is an open source tool which helps you deploy and manage infrastructure seamlessly across a veriety of providers. some of them are :

  

 1. Amazon Web Serv‚Äêices (AWS)
 2. Azure
 3. Google Cloud
 4. DigitalOcean

  

# Why

Writing infrstructeua as code is a powerful technuque. This mainly helps with the following:

 1. With code you can easily automate infra management
 2. reduce errors in complicated and time consuming configurations.
 3. do offline validation, diff or version control your changes
 4. let others resue your configuration easily

    state Advanced state management

  

- ## Common commands

- ### Apply

    Usage: terraform apply [options]  [DIR-OR-PLAN]
    
      
    
    Builds or changes infrastructure according to Terraform configuration
    
    files in DIR.
    
      
    
    By default, apply scans the current directory for the configuration
    
    and applies the changes appropriately. However, a path to another
    
    configuration or an execution plan can be provided. Execution plans can be
    
    used to only execute a pre-determined set of actions.
    
      
    
    Options:
    
      
    
    -backup=path Path to backup the existing state file before
    
    modifying. Defaults to the "-state-out" path with
    
    ".backup" extension. Set to "-" to disable backup.
    
      
    
    -auto-approve Skip interactive approval of plan before applying.
    
      
    
    -lock=true Lock the state file when locking is supported.
    
      
    
    -lock-timeout=0s Duration to retry a state lock.
    
      
    
    -input=true Ask for input for variables if not directly set.
    
      
    
    -no-color If specified, output won't contain any color.
    
      
    
    -parallelism=n Limit the number of parallel resource operations.
    
    Defaults to 10.
    
      
    
    -refresh=true Update state prior to checking for differences. This
    
    has no effect if a plan file is given to apply.
    
      
    
    -state=path Path to read and save state (unless state-out
    
    is specified). Defaults to "terraform.tfstate".
    
      
    
    -state-out=path Path to write state to that is different than
    
    "-state". This can be used to preserve the old
    
    state.
    
      
    
    -target=resource Resource to target. Operation will be limited to this
    
    resource and its dependencies. This flag can be used
    
    multiple times.
    
      
    
    -var 'foo=bar' Set a variable in the Terraform configuration. This
    
    flag can be set multiple times.
    
      
    
    -var-file=foo Set variables in the Terraform configuration from
    
    a file. If "terraform.tfvars" or any ".auto.tfvars"
    
    files are present, they will be automatically loaded.

  

- ### Destroy

    Usage: terraform destroy [options]  [DIR]
    
      
    
    Destroy Terraform-managed infrastructure.
    
      
    
    Options:
    
      
    
    -backup=path Path to backup the existing state file before
    
    modifying. Defaults to the "-state-out" path with
    
    ".backup" extension. Set to "-" to disable backup.
    
      
    
    -auto-approve Skip interactive approval before destroying.
    
      
    
    -force Deprecated: same as auto-approve.
    
      
    
    -lock=true Lock the state file when locking is supported.
    
      
    
    -lock-timeout=0s Duration to retry a state lock.
    
      
    
    -no-color If specified, output won't contain any color.
    
      
    
    -parallelism=n Limit the number of concurrent operations.
    
    Defaults to 10.
    
      
    
    -refresh=true Update state prior to checking for differences. This
    
    has no effect if a plan file is given to apply.
    
      
    
    -state=path Path to read and save state (unless state-out
    
    is specified). Defaults to "terraform.tfstate".
    
      
    
    -state-out=path Path to write state to that is different than
    
    "-state". This can be used to preserve the old
    
    state.
    
      
    
    -target=resource Resource to target. Operation will be limited to this
    
    resource and its dependencies. This flag can be used
    
    multiple times.
    
      
    
    -var 'foo=bar' Set a variable in the Terraform configuration. This
    
    flag can be set multiple times.
    
      
    
    -var-file=foo Set variables in the Terraform configuration from
    
    a file. If "terraform.tfvars" or any ".auto.tfvars"
    
    files are present, they will be automatically loaded.
