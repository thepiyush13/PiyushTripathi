# what is Terraform

Terraform is an open source tool which helps you deploy and manage infrastructure seamlessly across a veriety of providers. some of them are :

  

 1. Amazon Web Serv‚Äêices (AWS)
 2. Azure
 3. Google Cloud
 4. DigitalOcean

  

# Why Terraform

Writing infrstructeua as code is a powerful technuque. This mainly helps with the following:

 1. With code you can easily automate infra management
 2. reduce errors in complicated and time consuming configurations.
 3. do offline validation, diff or version control your changes
 4. let others resue your configuration easily

  

# Installing terraform
- Download the package from https://www.terraform.io/
- Add binary terraform to your PATH environment variable
- Setup Providers login details. For example setup AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY if you want to use terraform with AWS

  
  

# Using terraform

- Defining resources: create a file main.tf with the following 

    Simple syntex to use terraform is 

        resource "PROVIDER_TYPE" "NAME" {
            [CONFIG ...]
        }

    Example:

        resource "aws_instance" "test" {
            ami = "ami-xxxxx"
            instance_type = "t2.micro"
        }

- Creating resources: 
    Here we will try to create the actual resource
        
        terraform apply 
    
    (from folder where main.tf is)

- Destroying resources
        
        terraform destroy
    
    remove the created resource once no longer needed
